## How to run the notebook

1. Download [Anaconda]().
2. Download [cmder]() if on Windows.
3. Ensure that git is installed.
4. Create a blank folder in your cmder
5. 'cd' into the directory
6. 'git clone' repository "https://github.com/Emmanuel-Osabuehien/EmergingTechnologyProject.git"
7. 'cd' into the repository folder
8. Run `juypter lab`.
9. Jupyter should run in browser
10. You can restart and run all cells in either the 'scikit-learn.ipynb' or 'quantum-deutsch.ipynb' notebooks.
